    The program receives as parameters the name of the input file, the first command, the second command, and the name of the output file.
    The program creates a pipe (read-end fd[3] | write-end fd[4]).
    The program creates a child process.
        It open the input file fd[5].
        It redirects the stdout fd[1] to the pipe fd[4].
        Then redirects the input file fd[5] to the stdin fd[0].
        Close the read-end of the pipe fd[3].
        Execute the first command.
        The output of the first command is written to the pipe because the previous redirection.
        The child process exits.
    The program wait for the child process to finish.
    The program call the parent process.
        It open the output file fd[5].
        It redirects the stdin fd[0] to the pipe fd[3], that is, the output buffer of the first command.
        Then redirects the output file fd[5] to the stdout fd[1].
        Close the write-end of the pipe fd[4].
        Execute the second command.
        The output of the second command is written to the output because the previous redirection.
        The parent process exits.
    If you don't have any errors, the program ends successfully.
